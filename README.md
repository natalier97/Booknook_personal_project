![booknook_pic2](https://github.com/natalier97/personal_project/assets/154473227/ae60da86-f2b5-420b-b758-d1330d9f9f23)


BookNook is an application designed for book lovers to discover new books and efficiently organize their reading materials. With this application, users can create personal bookshelves, manage their reading lists, and interact with various APIs to enhance their reading experience. This project was completed in a *two-week timeframe* and I look forward to continue adding to and improving upon it.

# Basic MVP 
### CRUD Operations
*Utilizing Django REST Frameworks (Python), PostgreSQL, 3rd party APIs, and ReactJS (Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS)*
- Create: Users can create personal bookshelves to organize their reading materials.
- Read: They have the ability to view their bookshelves and explore the books they have added.
- Update: Users can update their bookshelves by adding or removing books.
- Delete: They can also delete shelves entirely if desired.
### Authentication
*Utilizing token authentication*
- Users can register, login, and logout.
- By logging in, they gain access to create, update, delete, and view their bookshelves.
### APIs Integration
*BookNook integrates with several APIs to enrich the user experience:*
- Google Books API
- OpenLibrary API
- NY Times Books API

## Future Booknook Application Goals
- *Deploy Application*
- *Book Rating and Reviews:* Users can rate books on a scale of 1 to 5 stars and leave reviews.
- *Friend Integration:* Possibly integrate features to connect with friends, share book recommendations, and discuss reading experiences.
- *OpenAI Integration:* Explore the possibility of integrating OpenAI to provide personalized book recommendations based on user preferences and reading history.
